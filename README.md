# Programming-assignment-1

I am hoping to create a Grocery store inventory management system using Pycharm.
The program would be created for grocery store managers and stocktakers to more efficiently manage and view their current and future product inventory.
This program should be able to save, remove or modify any products added to the program.
It should be able to show detailed descriptions of each product.
The managers should be able to distinguish products that have been added or removed for different reasons, either expired, broken, returned, sold etc.
Managers should be able to see who has added or removed products and at what time.
The program should have a clean and clear user interface making the program easy to learn and teach to new employees.
The user interface should have quality of life tools such as date and time built in.
The program should be able to calculate the value of the inventory and provide managers with reports over time.
